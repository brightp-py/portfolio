  <h3 id="wordlab">WordLab</h3>

  <p><img src="/img/urs-presentation-2022.jpg" alt="urs-presentation-2022.jpg" /></p>

  <p>I work as a research assistant in Dr. Lisa Levinson’s
<a href="https://umwordlab.github.io" target="_blank">WordLab</a>  at UofM. 
Our research focuses on the psycholinguistic properties of human language 
processing. I, in particular, use my experience in computer science to pursue 
the computational side of the topic, using language models to imitate human 
brains.</p>

  <p>In simpler terms:</p>

  <p>When you read a sentence, you brain has to take some amount of time to process 
each word. Depending on different factors, you make take more or less time to 
process a given word, based on how much effort it requires. Some of this time 
comes from simple factors, like word length and how common it is. Another 
component is <strong>surprisal</strong>, or how surprising it was to find this word in this 
context.</p>

  <p>We can simulate surprisal values using computational language models, which 
take a piece of a sentence and provide the probability that a given word 
follows. By taking the negative logarithms of these probabilities, we get 
values that are linearly correlated with reading times (along with other 
related psycholinguistic effects).</p>

  <p>Different language models have different capabilities when it comes to 
predicting reading times. Simple models like 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram" target="_blank">n-grams</a>, 
for instance, are poor predictors of psycholinguistic effects when n is low 
(bigrams), but improve as n increases.</p>

  <p>In my research, I primarily focus on the 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07776" target="_blank">RNNG</a> model, 
which goes beyond classic language models by building entire syntax trees, 
not just the sentence’s words.</p>

  <h3 id="first-alumni--mentor-network-at-michigan">FIRST Alumni &amp; Mentor Network at Michigan</h3>

  <p>When I was in high school, I participated in the 
<a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robotics Competition</a>, 
where teams of students build robots and use them to compete in tournaments. 
Working in this environment helped me figure out what kind of a team player I 
am, and how to commit to a project with a long term goal.</p>

  <p>Plus it was fun.</p>

  <p>When I got to college, I was still very excited about the program, and looked 
for other students who had participated. At some point, I happened across the 
FIRST logo drawn in chalk on the ground, with a time and place for an 
introductory meeting for a club: the FIRST Alumni &amp; Mentor Network at 
Michigan (FAMNM). The group’s goal was to get college students involved in 
mentoring high school teams and volunteering at FIRST events.</p>

  <p>I signed up and gave it my all. I ended up giving a presentation on scouting 
other teams’ stats just two months after joining the group, and I attended 
everything I could.</p>

  <p>After a year of being an active member, and just after the onset of the 
pandemic, I was voted in as the group’s Director of Internal Affairs. This 
gave me about the same authority as the Vice President, and was a really big 
responsibility when there was, y’know, a pandemic going on.</p>

  <p>For two years, I worked hard to hold the organization together in a new 
remote format. This meant getting a lot of practice keeping Zoom meetings 
engaging, designing a new format for each term’s elections, and scheduling 
times for members to just meet up and play games to stay involved.</p>

  <p>More than anything, my time as the Director of Internal Affairs was spent 
keeping the club stable through an extremely turbulent time. As in-person 
events we relied on were canceled, outreach opportunities were lost, and 
participation waned, it became our goal to just keep FAMNM’s torch burning.</p>

  <p>And we succeeded.</p>

  <p>Now, as we get back into the swing of things, it’s time to add more fuel to 
that fire. For my final term participating in FAMNM, I’ve taken on the 
position of Director of Marketing, meaning I’ll be heading all of our 
outreach and recruitment efforts.</p>

  <p>To get people involved in FIRST Robotics again, we’ll need to give students a 
chance to meet up with their fellow FIRST alumni to chat and build 
connections. We’ll need clear instructions on how to get involved with teams 
and volunteering. And we’ll need exciting ways to make our organization 
visible to the whole student body.</p>

  <p>In the end, my goal is to leave this amazing club as I found it, but refreshed 
and stronger than it ever was before.</p>

  <h3 id="helpful-engineering">Helpful Engineering</h3>

  <p>The start of the pandemic was a hectic time, to say the very least. Classes 
were canceled, dorms were vacated, assignments were excused, and goodbyes were 
made. I made my way to my parents’ home, 20 minutes away from school, to stay 
until we learned what was going on.</p>

  <p>What followed was a month of pure anxiety. Anxiety about my classes, and my 
apartment plans, and my job. But anxiety, first and foremost, about the health 
of my family and myself.</p>

  <p>Amidst all the chaos, I searched for some kind of outlet that would help me 
regain composure. One outlet was comedy TV (shoutout to 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Taskmaster">Taskmaster</a> for releasing free 
episodes on Youtube).</p>

  <p>Then I came across a brand new organization, 
<a href="https://helpfulengineering.org">Helpful Engineering</a> on Reddit whose goal was 
to design makeshift ventilators in the event that a community couldn’t afford 
enough for all who fell ill.</p>

  <p>I signed up and joined their Slack to find a disorganized group of brilliant, 
optimistic people who all wanted to help resolve this crisis. There were 
experts in medicine, engineering, business, and more, all with much more 
experience than a first year college student like myself.</p>

  <p>A few people were trying to form some type of cohesion between members of the 
group. One person set up a Google spreadsheet to contain all volunteers’ names 
and contact information, but it was clear that they were pretty new to 
collecting large amounts of data.</p>

  <p>I offered to take over and streamline the spreadsheet for volunteers. I’d 
spent a surprising amount of time in my first 1.5 terms of college learning 
to format and streamline spreadsheets, learning tricks from older members at 
FAMNM and experimenting with all sorts of spreadsheet-based tools.</p>

  <p>I tidied up the spreadsheet they gave me (alternating colors with white 
borders are my personal preference) and set up a Google Form that would 
automatically fill out the sheet. I also set up custom formatting that 
highlighted key members of the group, like moderators and leaders.</p>

  <p>Over the next few weeks, I became the primary maintainer of this first list of 
volunteers. I checked in frequently to fix any issues, add requested questions 
to the form, and implement new features for the organization to use. I watched 
the list of volunteers grow from 2, to 20, to 50, to 100, to 200, and beyond. 
Our group got a mention on a major Portuguese news network, so we received a 
huge influx of Portuguese members soon after, taking us from the hundreds to 
around 2,000 members.</p>

  <p>The craziest part of the experience, for me personally, was the amount of 
experience a lot of these members had. We had many doctors from across the 
globe offer what time they had to provide insight into the medical side of 
the operation. Quite a few CEOs of manufacturing companies, big and small, 
wanted to give Helpful Engineering access to their machinery for building 
equipment. Engineers, programmers, designers, and more signed up and formed 
groups for different projects, expanding the organization’s horizons beyond 
ventilators. And before any of these real world experts could collaborate and 
improve the world, they came to me, some 19-year-old watching British 
television, to put their name down. It was wild.</p>

  <p>I learned a lot about data entry and spreadsheet management over that month 
and a half. For example, try to avoid text entry boxes for things like 
“Country”. I had no idea there were so many ways to say you were from the 
United States. Standardizing that one question took up way too much time.</p>

  <p>But I also learned a lot about myself. I’m the anxious type, so I always 
worried that I’d collapse when put under too much pressure, or I’d lose hope 
when all seemed lost. But, apparently, when the world I know is falling apart 
around me, my first instinct is to find a way to help. It turns out I really 
do want to make the world a better place.</p>

  <p>And I’m proud of that.</p>
